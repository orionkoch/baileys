               policy with respect to your personal information including personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other

            <p>Last Updated: October 21, 2008</p>

            <p>Welcome to the web sites owned and operated by&nbsp;HP Hood LLC (&ldquo;HP
            Hood&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) but not
            limited to <a href="http://www.hphood.com">www.hphood.com</a> and <a href=
            "http://www.baileyscreamers.com">www.baileyscreamers.com</a> (a.k.a., the "Hood Web
            Sites"). This Privacy Policy sets forth HP Hood&rsquo;s policy with respect to
            information including personally identifiable information (&ldquo;Personal
            Information&rdquo;) and other information that is collected from Site visitors
            (&ldquo;you&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;your&rdquo;).</p>

            <h3>Types of Information We Collect</b>&nbsp;</h3>

            <h3>Contests and Sweepstakes</h3>

            <p>Our Site sometimes includes notices of promotions we are conducting, and we may
            permit you to enter such promotions electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we
            will use the Personal Information you provide for the purpose of conducting the
            promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner).</p>

            <h3>Questionnaires and Surveys</h3>

            <p>We may occasionally ask visitors to complete surveys and opinion polls about their
            attitudes and interests. Surveys help us to understand your needs. If sample answers
            to surveys are posted on the Site, no Personal Information will be included.</p>

            <h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>

            <p>If you specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our
            mailing list when you registered, we may contact you from time to time. For example,
            we may send you marketing or promotion materials; we may respond to your comments or
            requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the course of processing
            a product or service you requested through our Site.</p>

            <p>When you use our Recipe function, we collect whatever information you submit,
            whether it's in the form of comments that explain your opinions about a recipe or how
            to prepare it. Please remember that when you post your comments they will become
            publicly available, so you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose anything
            personal about yourself. In the e-mail section of our Site, we ask for Personal
            Information, such as your name and phone number. We use this Personal Information
            only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to contact you by e-mail
            were unsuccessful. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy and/or when
            we have your permission, we don't use your e-mail address for any purpose other than
            responding to the message you've sent.</p>

            <p>We also use Personal Information about you to improve our marketing and
            promotional efforts; to statistically analyze website usage; and to improve our
            features and content. We may also use your Personal Information to deliver content
            that is customized to your interests as we best understand them from the information
            you've provided to us and your activities on the Site. This customized content may
            include such things as recipes, banners, product information, and promotions. We do
            not collect Personal Information, but we may combine non-personal information
            collected automatically with your previously submitted Personal Information.</p>

            <h3>Third Parties Who Provide Support Services to HP Hood LLC</h3>

            <p>In the course of doing business, we employ other companies and individuals to
            perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, we hire agencies to help
            administer consumer promotions, to analyze data, to fulfill orders you place, and to
            provide customer service. These agents may have access to Personal Information if it
            is needed to perform their functions for Hood.</p>

            <h3>Data Sharing and Transfer</h3>

            <p>Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, transfer, or
            disclose the Personal Information we gather at our websites to third parties without
            your prior consent. There are certain limited exceptions to this rule: (1) We will
            disclose Personal Information in cases where we believe in good faith that it is
            necessary to prevent a crime or an injury to ourselves or third parties; (2) We
            disclose Personal Information to third parties who provide support services to us, as
            described above; and (3) As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses
            or assets and in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution
            or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

            <p>There may be times when we share aggregated Personal Information about our
            visitors (for example, the percentage of male and female visitors to our Site) with
            advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties in an effort to
            customize or enhance the content and advertising of our Site for our users. We may
            also aggregate Personal Information from web log files (such as your web browser,
            operating system, pages visited, etc.) to understand how users navigate the site and
            what features are most popular.</p>

            <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

            <p>HP Hood endeavors to make sure that every link on our Site sends you and/or your
            kids to a safe place on the Internet. However, websites and addresses change quickly,
            and HP Hood cannot guarantee the content of every third party website to which we
            provide a link. In addition, different websites have different privacy policies. You
            should always check the privacy policy of the specific site you're visiting to
            understand your rights.</p>

            <h3>Choice and Control</h3>

            <p>You are ultimately in control of the Personal Information you provide to us on our
            Site. For example, you can always change your preference for follow-up contacts by
            just calling our 1-800 number as mentioned on the About Hood page of our Site.</p>

            <h3>Important Note to Kids</h3>

            <p>Before providing your name, address, e-mail address, or any other personal
            information to anyone on the Internet, be sure to ask your parents if it's OK.</p>

            <h3>Children's Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>Our Web site conduct is governed by federal law and regulations that address
            children's online privacy, as well as by the guidelines of the Children's Advertising
            Review Unit (CARU), a part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.</p>

            <p>We do not directly collect Personal Information from kids under 13. We do
            sometimes offer promotions on the&nbsp;Site, such as a sweepstakes or contests but
            those promotions are not directed toward children under 18 years of age.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Should a child under the age of 13 provide personal information to us through our
            web site, upon proper identification, any parent can review any Personal Information
            we have collected from their child, if we are still maintaining the information in
            our operational database. They may also request that the Personal Information be
            deleted from our database, and refuse to permit further collection or use of their
            child's information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please
            contact HP Hood as described below.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

            <p>HP Hood takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information provided via
            the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
            destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or
            error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure.
            Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us
            via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to HP
            Hood via the Internet.</p>

            <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it
            may be necessary for HP Hood to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the
            right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time
            without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before
            you provide any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the
            date indicated above. Your continued use of the Site after any changes or revisions
            to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised
            Privacy Policy.</p>
